        Whether this drive is read and writeable without any error or warnings.
        It's the single preliminary check on whether things go wrong.
        Noted: even from user's view, RAID degrade does not cause any
        error or warning at OS level, the 'isOK' property will still be set
        as 'FALSE' to suggest user to do more checking on what's going on.

        Whether this drive is degraded RAID, for example, one disk failure
        in RAID 5 group is considered as degraded RAID.

    <!-- IsRaidError:
        Whether this drive is facing RAID error, for example, two disks
        failure in RAID 5 group at the same time is considered as RAID error,
        user will lose data access and facing write failure.

    <!-- RaidType:
         A string of backend RAID type of this disk drive.
         Could be one of these values:
            JBOD, RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, RAID 6, RAID 10, RAID 50, RAID 60

         A message for administrator about RAID detail issue.
         Some examples:
            Disk enclosure 1 slot 9(serial: CVDA452606ME1207GN) is offline.
            Disk enclosure 1 slot 10 is predicted to be fail soon.

        The minimum I/O size, device preferred I/O size for random I/O.
        Any I/O size not equal to a multiple of this value may get
        significant speed penalty. Normally it refers to strip size of
        each RAID disk(extent). If LibStorageMgmt failed to detect min_io_size,
        it will try these values in the sequence of:
            logical sector size -> physical sector size ->  0

        failed to detect opt_io_size, it will be set to 0.

        The count of disk assebled the RAID group where this disk drive came
